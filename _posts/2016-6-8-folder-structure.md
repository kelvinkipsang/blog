Hold on to your trousers, today I plan on being a little pedantic, but in retrospect...what is programming if not codes with an overload of pedantry.

Websites of this age have a couple of items tied to them. Typically, you would have your HTML pages, CSS files and javascript files. I assume you are conversant with what each of these are, but since we are being meticulous:

HTML - This is where your content goes, mainly text and images.
CSS - This files style your content, give it color and beauty.
Javascript(which has no relation to the JAVA programming language) - This gives your content some behavior and makes it dynamic, it sort of brings your site to life, if you could say so.

Back to my point, there is a convention folder and file structure that each website should adhere to so that referencing is easy and it is understandable to other developers.

I'll make it a little visual for you

```
        index.html
        about.html
        *css>style.css
        *js>style.js
        *img>img1.jpg
             img2.jpg
             img3.jpg
```
