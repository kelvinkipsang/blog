title: It's all in the semantics.

Sections v Divs, the age old battle. While working on a collaboration project with one of my friends, I noticed that he had a bad case of the divitis. All his code was plastered with divs, what a site!(for me). I, on the other hand, stuck to a well balanced mixture of section tags and divs which enraged him from our numerous merge conflicts. So, what really is the difference? As i said before, it's all in the semantics. This means that the use of either is defined by what kind of content you are displaying. It would look absurd to flood your code with divs, which happens in most cases. Use sections where you have a defined part of information and divs as a by-the-way chunk of information.
