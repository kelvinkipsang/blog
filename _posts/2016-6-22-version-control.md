title: Ah, version control.
---

In this day and age, people are still carrying their million dollar ideas in flash disks! Yes, I was as shocked as you are. Let's shape up people, crawl out from that rock you've been living, and get some version control all up in yah!

Welcome then everyone to version control, which is exactly what it is, making versions of your project and having control over those versions. Take [Github](https://github.com/) for example, which I happen to be very fond of, it takes multiple versions of your software and stores it on a server online. You can make as many versions as you please, change the project, add collaborators...in short maximum control. For those in the stone age, think of it as an unlimited flash disk online.

So, benefits. Multiple versions of a project, if something happens to your computer, you can easily retrieve your data, adding of  collaborators without regard to distance...they are a well-full of benefits, and it makes project co-ordination so much easier.

I beg you fellow syntax-heads, come over to the light side. Have some version control...

#### Challenge:

Head over to [Github](https://github.com/) and try to hack their "Hello world" repository. From then on, run away with version control!
