title: What is that, is it a bird, a plane? No, it's ExFAT

It's been a while, eh.Let's veer away from programming for a second, moving stuff, especially from one OS to another. File systems are a pain in the neck and you might have to format your external drive every time you need to use a different file system, which also doesn't guarantee its use.

So, what do we do? Microsoft mostly uses NTFS which is read-only on Mac, Mac on the other hand uses something that sounds like it is used to make a hydrogen bomb. You can already see the nightmares...luckily, however, there came FAT32 which can take on both operating systems. The catch is that it has a 4GB limit especially on Mac, which can make you reap a few things.
