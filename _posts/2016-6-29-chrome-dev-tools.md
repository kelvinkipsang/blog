Bugs! The bane to any programmer. However, I see them as an initiation into jedihood. The more you overcome, the more robust you get. How then do you go around squashing those buggers?

Welcome then, to the Chrome Developer Tools. What this is in a nutshell is a debugging tool for HTML/CSS and JavaScript on the Chrome browser. I'm sure you are familiar with that overwhelming sensation when you type out code and nothing works. For the said languages, you can debbug on Chrome Dev Tools. It will show you where you went wrong. The beauty is that it comes with a console, for all you Js lovers out there, so you can kind of dry run your code and if it works, transfer it to your editor.

I know, it is seems as something that decended from the above. In the right hands, it can be a very powerful tool, so learn it!

May the code be ever in your favor.
