Bugs! The bane to any programmer, they make us all shiver with fear brrr!. However, I see them as an initiation into jedihood. The more you overcome, the more robust you get. How then do you go around squashing those buggers?

Welcome then, to the Chrome Developer Tools. What this is in a nutshell is a debugging tool for HTML/CSS and JavaScript on the Chrome browser. Other browsers do come with developer tools, but let's be real, chrome be da real MVP. I'm sure you are familiar with that overwhelming sensation when you type out code and nothing works, for the said languages, you can debbug on Chrome Dev Tools. It will show you where you went wrong. The beauty is that it comes with a console, for all you javascipt lovers out there,like me, so you can kind of dry run your code and if it works, transfer it to your editor.

Another beauty of this tool is that it comes with a pane to check how responsive your site is. This checks if your site scales on various devices from a ginormous Mac to a Nexus. That in itself is life-changing. This means you do not have to have a bunk full of computers of various sizes to check for responsiveness of your site.

I know, it is seems as something that decended from the above, but, in the right hands, it can be a very powerful tool. So, get the right hands.

May the code be ever in your favor.
