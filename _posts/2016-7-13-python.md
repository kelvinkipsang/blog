title: Python, You Pedantic Bastard!
---

Let's talk Python for a bit. I just started learning how to program in Pyhton, oh the fun! I find it really easy to read out, but don't underestimate it ferocity, it's like a looming anaconda, asleep though.

The syntax is really easy to grasp but you have to be mindful of indetation. Oh my, the indentation!
