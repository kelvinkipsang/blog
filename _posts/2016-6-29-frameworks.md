Making a website, Whoosh! It's tedious stuff, isn't it? All those lines of code, tell me about it eh. And then you veiw it on mobile and have to scroll miles away because it just doesn't fit.

What if I told you that your struggle days are over? What if I told you that there was a solution to end the tiresome work that goes into floating that picture to left just right? Well yes, there is a solution. Frameworks.

Essentially, Frameworks are predefined lines of code that help you do the dirty work. They have code for styling, positioning and much more. The beauty of it is that the same code can be used infinte times. Thinkof it literally. Usually they will come with a CSS folder for web frameworks, all you have to do is place it in your folder structure and link it in your HTML files at the ```<head></head>``` section.

Therefore, if you want to escape billions of lines of code...use a framework. Code less, make more padawan!
